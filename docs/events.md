# OpenCode Event Protocol

> **Document role:** canonical owner for the normalized runtime event protocol, renderer handling inventory, and event-specific semantics.

The main process subscribes to the OpenCode V2 SSE stream
(`client.event.subscribe()`) through a transport pipeline
(`src/main/stream-pipeline.ts`) and forwards **every** event to the renderer
as `{ kind: "event", type, data }` (`BackendMessage`). The renderer dispatch
lives in `src/renderer/src/store.tsx` (the `onMessage` effect).

Session events are routed by `data.sessionID` into a per-session transcript
and busy-state store, so every open panel streams independently: child and
subagent streams keep flowing while the user works in another panel, and
model/agent selections land on the panel that owns the session.

DeepSeek mux and host WebSockets enter the same renderer vocabulary through
the runtime adapter. `assistant/chunk` block starts, deltas, and ends become
the corresponding `session.text.*`, `session.reasoning.*`, and
`session.tool.input.*` events. Final Assistant and Tool records reconcile via
`message.*` and `session.tool.*`; retries remove the failed partial before
publishing `session.retry.scheduled`. Prompt submission never drives a history
polling loop, so pushed events are the live authority for both runtimes.

Failure records use the shared `{code, message, details?}` shape from
`src/shared/errors.ts`. Missing provider/runtime codes receive a stable `ORBIT_*`
code, and the renderer includes the code in the persistent timeline error and
toast. Prompt IPC rejection, runtime execution failure, stream failure, malformed
events, and event-delivery failure all produce a report instead of being silently
dropped.

Incoming events use the same scheduling strategy as OpenChamber: the main
process queues events per directory and flushes one batch per 33ms frame.
Deltas for the same part (`session.text.delta`, `session.reasoning.delta`,
`session.tool.input.delta`, `session.compaction.delta`, `message.part.delta`)
are concatenated while they share a coalescing key; an authoritative snapshot
(`session.text.ended`, `session.reasoning.ended`, `session.tool.input.ended`,
terminal tool events, `message.part.updated`) clears that part's delta key so
a delta arriving after the snapshot never merges into a pre-snapshot delta the
snapshot already covers. `session.idle` / `session.error` /
`session.created` / `session.deleted` clear the `session.status` coalescing
key. A 30s heartbeat aborts a silent stream and reconnects immediately without
emitting a user-facing error; stream failures retry with exponential backoff
(250ms base, ×2, 5s cap). A subscription counts as connected only once it
delivers an event, so an endpoint that never answers keeps accumulating
failures and reports one user-facing `global.error` per outage instead of one
per retry cycle. After three consecutive failed attempts the backend drops its
client and the next attempt re-runs `connect()`, which discovers or ensures a
live service, so a dead or replaced daemon recovers without an app restart. A
stream that delivered events emits a synthetic `server.connected` when it
reconnects so the renderer re-materializes open sessions. The pipeline also emits `server.connected`
whenever the SSE stream ends cleanly (`onStreamEnd`) or the heartbeat aborts a
silent stream, so a stream that goes quiet mid-response (server-side stall
after a large response) still triggers a full re-materialization that recovers
any terminal events (e.g. `session.execution.succeeded`) missed in the gap.

The renderer keeps an authoritative per-session chat store
(`src/renderer/src/chat-store.ts`): server messages and parts in binary-search
ordered maps keyed by message/part id, plus a session status map. Events
mutate the store; the visible transcript is a projection of it. Full part
snapshots replace streaming state with dedupe bookkeeping
(`__dedupeNextDeltaFields`) so a trailing delta already included in the
snapshot is not applied twice, and a finished tool card is never regressed by
a stale running snapshot. When the store detects an incomplete session
snapshot (an orphan delta, a delta for an unknown part, or a part whose
owning message is missing) it materializes that session over
`shell:session-transcript` and merges the authoritative history without
regressing longer live text.

## Events the renderer handles

| Event type | What the store does |
|---|---|
| `session.created` | Adds or reconciles the session graph entry, including `parentID`, agent, title, and directory so task calls can resolve child sessions |
| `session.renamed` | Updates the matching session title and timestamp |
| `session.deleted` | Removes the session from the graph |
| `session.inbox.enqueued` | Buffers user/synthetic inbox items as an internal `pending-input` keyed by `inboxID`; user entries also join the session's queued-chip list; it does not create a visible chat row |
| `session.inbox.delivered` | Materializes the buffered input as the canonical user/synthetic timeline entry, reconciles an optimistic local user message by text, and drops the entry from the queued-chip list |
| `session.inbox.cancelled` | Discards the buffered input by `inboxID` and drops the entry from the queued-chip list without removing a delivered chat message |
| `form.created` | Normalizes the incoming form and shows it as a dock card above the composer for the addressed session |
| `form.replied` | Removes the answered form's dock card |
| `form.cancelled` | Removes the cancelled form's dock card |
| `session.execution.started` | Authoritatively marks both the chat session and composer busy; activity is shown by the agent header rather than a transcript status bubble |
| `session.execution.succeeded` | Authoritatively marks the chat session and composer idle, completes the active assistant, and clears retry state without adding transcript noise |
| `session.execution.failed` | Authoritatively marks the chat session non-busy with an error state, completes the active assistant, clears retry state, and adds an error status line |
| `session.execution.interrupted` | Authoritatively marks the chat session non-busy with an error state, completes the active assistant, clears retry state, and adds an error status line |
| `session.idle` | Sets `busy = false` and completes the active assistant |
| `session.error` | Records the structured failure on the active assistant, marks the chat session errored, sets `busy = false`, and adds a persistent error status line so a failed run cannot disappear or leave the composer stuck on the running/stop icon |
| `global.error` | Shows a structured background/transport failure in the error toast when no session can be safely attached |
| `session.status` | Mirrors OpenCode `busy` / `idle` / `retry` / `error`; an `error` status clears `busy` (and the chat store records a non-busy `error` status); retry details attach to the latest assistant. A retry carrying a `free_tier_limit` or `account_rate_limit` action appends an error `status` transcript item (`buildRateLimitNotice` in `src/renderer/src/chat-store.ts`) on the first attempt so the user sees the rate-limit reason and resolution link inline |
| `session.step.started` | Creates or reopens the addressed assistant message in the authoritative chat store, marks the chat session busy, clears its retry/error state, and completes a different unfinished assistant |
| `session.step.ended` | Completes the addressed assistant message; a terminal finish marks the chat session idle while `tool-calls` keeps the multi-step turn active |
| `session.step.failed` | Completes the assistant, records the structured failure, and marks the session errored so a failed step cannot remain busy |
| `session.text.started` | Adds one ordered text part for the message/ordinal |
| `session.text.delta` | Appends streamed text to that part (materializing the session if the message or part is unknown) |
| `session.text.ended` | Replaces the part with the authoritative final text, preserves its OpenCode phase, marks it complete, and dedupes trailing deltas; `commentary` projects into the turn's stable Think row while `final_answer` remains assistant body text |
| `session.reasoning.started` | Adds one ordered reasoning part behind a collapsed Thinking disclosure in event order |
| `session.reasoning.delta` | Appends native streamed reasoning to the active collapsed Think row without manufacturing intermediate characters when a runtime sends a one-shot summary |
| `session.reasoning.ended` | Replaces the part with authoritative final reasoning and keeps it available through the disclosure after completion |
| `session.tool.input.started` | Adds an inline tool part with its real name and begins the argument buffer |
| `session.tool.input.delta` | Appends to the live tool argument buffer |
| `session.tool.input.ended` | Replaces the argument buffer with authoritative input text |
| `session.tool.called` | Applies parsed input, detail, clickable paths, and start time without regressing a terminal card |
| `session.tool.progress` | Displays current tool progress metadata |
| `session.tool.success` | Marks a running tool successful, reads V2 content blocks or legacy output, and records duration |
| `session.tool.failed` | Marks a running tool failed, preserves content/error output, records duration, and auto-expands the card |
| `session.retry.scheduled` | Marks the session retrying and attaches attempt, structured error, and next-attempt time to the assistant |
| `session.synthetic` | Retains the synthetic/system message; internal `<system-reminder>` content is filtered from the visible timeline |
| `session.skill.activated` | Adds the activated skill name, id, and supplied text to the timeline |
| `session.shell.started` | Adds a running shell message with its command |
| `session.shell.ended` | Reconciles the shell by id with status, exit code, and captured output |
| `session.compaction.started` | Adds a live compaction entry and its reason/recent context |
| `session.compaction.delta` | Streams the compaction summary into the active compaction entry |
| `session.compaction.ended` | Finalizes the authoritative compaction summary |
| `session.compaction.failed` | Finalizes compaction with its structured error |
| `message.updated` | Upserts the authoritative assistant message (skipped when unchanged) with its completion/error state; terminal assistant finishes (`stop`, `length`, content filter, error, or unknown) authoritatively mark the chat session non-busy even if `session.idle` is delayed or absent |
| `message.removed` | Removes the assistant message and its parts from the authoritative store |
| `message.part.updated` | Authoritatively reconciles an ordered text, reasoning, or tool part; tool snapshots use `callID` to merge with their live row while retaining fields omitted by the snapshot, and missing owning messages request materialization |
| `message.part.delta` | Appends a text/input/output field delta; orphan and missing-part deltas trigger materialization |
| `message.part.removed` | Removes the part from the authoritative store |
| `server.connected` | Re-materializes every open session from the authoritative message history (emitted by the server and synthetically by main after a stream reconnect) |
| `global.disposed` | Same full re-materialization after the server reports its stream was disposed |
| `session.model.selected` | Retains internal model-switch metadata and updates `currentModel` for the addressed session's panel; it does not create a chat row |
| `session.agent.selected` | Retains internal agent-switch metadata and updates `currentAgent` for the addressed session's panel; it does not create a chat row |
| `agent.updated` | Refetches the agent catalog for the addressed session so the composer agent picker recovers from a lazy or empty first load |
| `catalog.updated` | Refetches the model catalog for the addressed session so the composer model picker stays current |
| `models-dev.refreshed` | Legacy model-catalog change event; handled identically to `catalog.updated` |
| `session.usage.updated` | Records cumulative session token usage (`tokens`) and cost (`cost`) for the addressed session; drives the token-usage popup in the agent header (context-window utilization is computed renderer-side from `tokens.input` vs the active model's `limit.context` delivered by `shell:models`) |
| `session.usage.recorded` | Same usage snapshot as `session.usage.updated` on the durable legacy stream; handled identically |
| `todo.updated` | Replaces the addressed session's todo list rendered in the dock above its composer; `todowrite` tool-part input/metadata is also consumed as a beta-protocol fallback |
| `permission.asked` | Appends a permission card (`action`, `resources`, pending=true); periodic reconciliation confirms pending requests and resolves cards whose requests vanish (for example, when answered in an attached TUI) |
| `permission.replied` | Marks `data.requestID` resolved, recording `resolvedWith` from `data.reply` |

## Events forwarded but NOT handled

The store has no case for these; they arrive on the wire and are dropped
by the switch statement. Revisit when adding features:

- `session.moved`, `session.forked`
- `session.inbox.delivery.changed`
- `session.compaction.admitted`, `session.revert.*`
- `filesystem.changed`, `reference.updated` (the main process handles the
  filesystem event separately; see below)
- `project.*`, `plugin.*`, `command.*`, `skill.*`, `mcp.*`, `vcs.*`,
  `websearch.*`, `pty.*`, `tui.*`, `config.*`

The main process accepts both `type` and the legacy SSE `event` field when it
forwards an event. The renderer accepts current `data` and legacy `properties`
envelopes, plus `id` and `callID` tool identifiers. `permission.v2.*` names are
adapted to `permission.*`. This lets the same reducer work with the installed
OpenCode client, the latest upstream protocol, and older opencode2 services.

## Main-process event handling

The transport pipeline in `src/main/stream-pipeline.ts` (see the scheduling
paragraph above) delivers per-directory batches into `deliverEvents` in
`src/main/opencode.ts`, which forwards each event and then runs
`handleServerEvent`. `deliverEvents` drops interactive prompts (`form.*`,
`permission.*`, `session.inbox.*`) for sessions Orbit never opened: the
global daemon is shared with external `opencode` terminal sessions, and
forwarding those prompts would misattribute them to the focused panel
(`form.created` carries its session only inside `data.form`, so
`eventSessionID` also descends into `form`). Location-global forms are the
exception: main canonicalizes the event location, attaches the matching open
session ids, and forwards the request only when Orbit owns that location.
Child/subagent transcript streams still flow; the renderer keeps them in
separate stored state.
`handleServerEvent` intercepts two types after forwarding:

- `session.tool.called` → `snapshotInputs(context, input)` snapshots structured
  file paths for the session context addressed by the event's `sessionID`
  before execution when possible. Shell command strings are not parsed
  as paths.
- `filesystem.changed` → `onFsChanged(file)` for every open session context
  whose directory matches the event's top-level `location.directory`; a shared
  directory fans the event out to each of its contexts. Global events from
  directories without an open session are ignored.

## Tool-card data flow (trace)

```
input.started {id/callID, name} ─► ordered tool part + empty input
input.delta   {id/callID, delta}─► tool.input += delta
input.ended   {id/callID, text} ─► authoritative tool.input
called        {id/callID, input}─► detail + paths + parsed input
progress      {id/callID, data} ─► live progress metadata
success/failed{id/callID, ...}  ─► terminal status + output + duration
```

Every update addresses the assistant message plus the tool call. A missing
part is created so a late subscription can recover, while a success/failed
part is terminal and cannot regress when an older running event arrives.

Tool parts retain the protocol's parsed input, content blocks, metadata,
`executed` flag, provider state, and provider-result state. Text content drives
the expandable output and file content becomes an attachment link. Edit and
patch parts additionally carry `metadata.files[]` (`file`, `patch`, `status`,
`additions`, `deletions`); when present the timeline renders them as a dedicated
diff card instead of a generic tool trigger (see `EditToolCard` in
`OpenCodeTimeline.tsx`).

## Parent and child sessions

The global SSE subscription includes every child session. The renderer stores
those streams separately rather than mixing them into the parent transcript.
Task cards resolve a child from `metadata.sessionId`/`sessionID`, then fall back
to the newest session whose `parentID`, title/description, and agent match the
task input. Opening the card replays and activates that child; its header links
back to the parent. Permission replies carry the owning session id so a child
request is never sent to the parent session.
