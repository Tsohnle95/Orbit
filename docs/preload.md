# Module: preload bridge

> **Document role:** canonical owner for the renderer-to-main preload bridge contract (`window.openshell`).

`src/preload/index.ts` — a thin `contextBridge` layer that exposes the
renderer's only gateway to the main process: `window.openshell`.

The API object is typed as `OpenShellApi` (`typeof api`) and is the type
source for `src/renderer/src/global.d.ts`. If you add an IPC channel in
the main process, add the wrapper here and it flows to the renderer
automatically.

## Contract

| Member | Type |
|---|---|
| `platform()` | `string` — `process.platform` (not an invoke; the renderer uses it for the darwin titlebar inset) |
| `isPackaged()` | `boolean` — true when main added the `--openshell-packaged` flag; the renderer hides install affordances in packaged builds |
| `onMessage(cb)` | `(msg: BackendMessage) => void`, returns unsubscribe |
| `selectFolder(generation, runtimeID?)` | `Promise<SessionInfo \| null>` — native dialog; the caller decides mounting (replace panels, add a model panel, or swap an existing panel's directory) |
| `selectDirectory()` | `Promise<string \| null>` — native directory dialog that returns a canonical folder path without creating a runtime session; used only to save an Orbit workspace bookmark |
| `selectFile(generation, runtimeID?)` | `Promise<OpenFileWorkspaceResult \| null>` — native single-file dialog; opens the file's parent folder through the selected runtime and reports which file to open |
| `openFileWorkspace(file, generation, runtimeID?)` | `Promise<OpenFileWorkspaceResult>` — opens an absolute path as a single-file workspace through the selected runtime (parent folder session + the file to open), no dialog |
| `openSession(dir, generation, runtimeID?)` | `Promise<SessionInfo>` — creates a session through OpenCode by default or the selected runtime; model mode uses the renderer's explicit additive action |
| `runtimes()` | `Promise<RuntimeManifest[]>` — installed status, versions, and normalized capability manifests |
| `sessions()` | `Promise<SessionSummary[]>` — recent session list |
| `activeSessions()` | `Promise<SessionInfo[]>` — currently open backend sessions in activation order; the last element is the most recently activated (used for startup restore) |
| `closeSession(workspace)` | `Promise<void>` — tears down the backend context when a panel closes; the opencode session remains reopenable |
| `openSessionById(sessionID, generation, runtimeID?)` | `Promise<ReopenedSession>` (session + replayed transcript + cumulative `usage`); idempotent for already-open sessions and resolves persisted runtime identity when omitted. A `runtimeID` that differs from the session's native runtime and targets no active context remaps the session to the requested runtime on the same directory |
| `deleteSession(sessionID)` | `Promise<void>` — permanently destroys the opencode session server-side (`client.session.remove`) and closes its panel; DeepSeek sessions are rejected (no delete RPC) |
| `sessionTranscript(sessionID)` | `Promise<{transcript, todos}>` — authoritative message replay used to materialize incomplete stream snapshots |
| `sessionUsage(sessionID)` | `Promise<SessionUsage \| null>` — normalized `cost`/`tokens` for the addressed session; used after `session.compaction` to refresh the context-window display |
| `prompt(workspace, text, files?, delivery?)` | Sends the prompt; `delivery` is `"queue"` or `"steer"` for follow-ups while busy |
| `inboxList(workspace)` | `Promise<SessionInboxEntry[]>` — queued entries for the panel's session |
| `inboxCancel(workspace, inboxID)` | `Promise<void>` — cancels a queued entry |
| `inboxSteer(workspace, inboxID)` | `Promise<void>` — delivers a queued entry immediately |
| `formsList(workspace)` | `Promise<PendingFormRequest[]>` — pending session and location-global agent forms for the panel |
| `formReply(workspace, formID, answers, formSessionID?)` | `Promise<void>` — replies through the form's session or location-global route |
| `formCancel(workspace, formID, formSessionID?)` | `Promise<void>` — cancels through the form's session or location-global route |
| `providerOauthStart(workspace, integrationID, methodID)` | `Promise<ProviderOAuthAttempt>` — begins the OAuth flow |
| `providerOauthPoll(workspace, integrationID, attemptID)` | `Promise<ProviderOAuthPoll>` — pending/complete/failed/expired |
| `providerOauthComplete(workspace, integrationID, attemptID, code?)` | `Promise<void>` — confirms an attempt (code mode) |
| `providerOauthCancel(workspace, integrationID, attemptID)` | `Promise<void>` — aborts an attempt |
| `mcpList(workspace)` | `Promise<McpServerOption[]>` — configured MCP servers with status |
| `pluginsList(workspace)` | `Promise<PluginOption[]>` — active plugins with source |
| `skillsList(workspace)` | `Promise<SkillOption[]>` — workspace skills |
| `revertStage(workspace, messageID, files)` | `Promise<SessionRevertStage>` — stages a revert of the panel's session to a message |
| `revertCommit(workspace)` | `Promise<void>` — applies the staged revert |
| `revertClear(workspace)` | `Promise<void>` — discards the staged revert |
| `commands(workspace)` | `Promise<CommandOption[]>` — slash commands + skills for the session directory (`kind` distinguishes them) |
| `runCommand(workspace, name, args?)` | `Promise<void>` — runs a slash command or skill in the addressed session |
| `references(workspace, query)` | `Promise<ReferenceOption[]>` — `file.find` search results for @-mentions, `rel` paths relative to the session directory |
| `selectFiles()` | `Promise<string[]>` |
| `selectImages()` | `Promise<string[]>` — image-filtered multi-file dialog |
| `readImagePreview(file)` | `Promise<string \| null>` — data-URL thumbnail for a local image path |
| `interrupt(workspace)` | `Promise<void>` |
| `listDir(workspace, rel)` | `Promise<TreeEntry[]>` |
| `revealInFileManager(workspace, rel)` | `Promise<void>` — validates and reveals a file or folder in the operating system's native file manager; missing items fail without changing workspace or editor state |
| `readFile(workspace, rel)` | `Promise<string \| null>` — workspace-relative only |
| `openExternal(workspace, file)` | `Promise<ExternalOpenResult>` — resolves an absolute path against the workspace: `{kind:"relative", rel, content}` when the file lives under the workspace root (open it normally) or `{kind:"standalone", path, content}` when outside it (open as a standalone tab) |
| `externalKind(file)` | `Promise<ExternalKind>` — probes an absolute path as `file`/`directory`/`missing` so explorer drops can route files to standalone tabs and folders to imports |
| `getPathForFile(file)` | `string` — synchronous (not an invoke): `webUtils.getPathForFile` is the Electron 32+ replacement for the removed `File.path`, exposed so renderer drop handlers can recover absolute paths from dropped OS files |
| `writeStandalone(file, content, expectedContent, overwrite)` | `Promise<void>` — atomic standalone-file write (conflict-checked unless `overwrite`) for external tabs outside the workspace root |
| `importExternal(workspace, destDir, sources)` | `Promise<ImportResult[]>` — copies external files/folders into the workspace at `destDir`, seeding clean baselines so imports never show as changes |
| `writeFile(workspace, rel, content, write)` | `Promise<void>` |
| `createFile(workspace, rel)` | `Promise<void>` — creates an empty file, erroring if it exists |
| `createDir(workspace, rel)` | `Promise<void>` — creates a folder, erroring if it exists |
| `deletePath(workspace, rel)` | `Promise<void>` — moves to Trash and preserves failures without permanent deletion |
| `detachPath(workspace, rel)` | `Promise<void>` — moves an entry outside the workspace while preserving its contents |
| `renamePath(workspace, rel, newName)` | `Promise<void>` — renames within the same folder |
| `movePath(workspace, rel, newParent)` | `Promise<void>` — moves a file or folder into another folder; empty `newParent` is the workspace root |
| `recoveryRecords(workspace)` | `Promise<RecoveryRecord[]>` — persistent durable artifacts for the addressed workspace |
| `openRecovery(workspace, id)` | `Promise<void>` — opens a validated artifact selected by record id |
| `acknowledgeRecovery(workspace, id)` | `Promise<void>` — persists acknowledgment without deleting bytes |
| `projects()` | `Promise<ProjectInfo[]>` |
| `models(workspace)` | `Promise<ModelOption[]>` |
| `modelDefault(workspace)` | `Promise<ModelOption \| null>` |
| `switchModel(workspace, id, providerID, variant?)` | `Promise<void>` |
| `agents(workspace)` | `Promise<AgentOption[]>` |
| `switchAgent(workspace, id)` | `Promise<void>` |
| `terminalStart(workspace, id, directory?)` | `Promise<string \| void>`; `id` is a renderer-generated `term-<UUID>` registered before invoke; new main processes return the validated cwd, while `void` remains accepted so a hot-reloaded renderer can move a terminal opened by an older main process into the requested directory |
| `terminalInput(workspace, id, data)` | `Promise<void>` |
| `terminalResize(workspace, id, cols, rows)` | `Promise<void>` |
| `terminalStop(workspace, id)` | `Promise<void>` |
| `agentTuiStart(workspace, id)` | `Promise<void>`; starts the active runtime's TUI in the addressed workspace |
| `agentTuiInput(workspace, id, data)` | `Promise<void>`; forwards xterm input through the terminal ownership checks |
| `agentTuiResize(workspace, id, cols, rows)` | `Promise<void>`; forwards xterm dimensions through the terminal validation |
| `agentTuiStop(workspace, id)` | `Promise<void>`; stops the panel's TUI PTY |
| `permissionReply(workspace, requestID, reply, sessionID)` | `Promise<void>` |
| `listPermissions(workspace)` | `Promise<PendingPermissionRequest[]>` — pending permission requests across the service's sessions |
| `state()` | `Promise<SessionInfo \| null>` — the most recently activated session |
| `sessionSelection(workspace)` | `Promise<SessionSelection \| null>` |
| `providerUsage()` | `Promise<ProviderUsageResult[]>` |
| `providerIntegrations(workspace)` | `Promise<ProviderIntegration[]>` — provider-neutral catalog and secret-free connection state supplied by the active runtime adapter |
| `connectProviderKey(workspace, integrationID, key, label, answers)` | `Promise<void>` — sends a write-only key and provider-specific form answers; the key is never returned to the renderer |
| `removeProviderCredential(workspace, credentialID)` | `Promise<void>` — removes one stored credential by opaque id |
| `health()` | `Promise<boolean>` |
| `windowView(view)` | `Promise<void>` — asks the main process to switch between the `"landing"` and `"session"` window profiles |
| `setAppearance(appearance)` | `Promise<void>` — reports the active theme's native appearance (`"dark"` for Original and Kitty Glass, `"light"` for Paper) so window vibrancy and native chrome stay on the theme's side of light/dark |
| `installApp()` | `Promise<{ok: boolean, message: string}>` — macOS-only: builds the packaged app and installs it to `/Applications`; `ok` false with a message on failure |
| `validateW3c(path, content)` | `Promise<W3cDiagnostic[]>` — validates HTML/CSS source through the W3C services |
| `viteStart(workspace, entryPath?)` | `Promise<VitePreview>` — serves a confined active HTML file from its containing directory, or the workspace root when omitted, and opens the verified loopback URL in the default browser |
| `viteStop(workspace)` | `Promise<void>` — stops the workspace's Vite dev server when one is running |
| `takePendingPaths()` | `Promise<string[]>` — drains OS-dropped or launch paths queued before the renderer was ready |

All are `ipcRenderer.invoke` wrappers over the `shell:*` channels
documented in `docs/main.md`. `onMessage` subscribes to
`ipcRenderer.on("shell:message")` and removes the listener on
unsubscribe.

Security posture: `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, and
`sandbox: true`. The renderer has no direct Node or Electron access. Main
accepts bridge invokes only from the active window's trusted main frame and
trusted application URL; a document that navigates elsewhere or an untrusted
subframe cannot use the exposed API. Workspace filesystem and terminal calls
also require a live `WorkspaceIdentity` matching an open backend session
context; stale or unknown identities are rejected in main. Main validates
bounded runtime schemas for activation and session IDs, prompts and
attachments, runtime ids, command/search payloads, model/agent selection, permission
replies, provider keys and form answers, filesystem writes, and terminal arguments. The standalone-file channels
(`openExternal`, `writeStandalone`) are the one bridge surface that accepts
arbitrary absolute paths; main bounds them (length/NUL/size caps) and `realpath`s
them to a regular file before reading or wiring an atomic write, so they behave
like the workspace channels but without a recovery store (standalone files always
live outside the watched workspace root).
